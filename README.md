# Carbon Emission Analysis

## Background
Greenhouse gases trap heat and make the planet warmer. 
Human activities are responsible for almost all of the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere over the last 150 years
Burning fossil fuels for electricity, heat, and transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions from human activities in the United States.

To understand the impact of power plants on the US GHG emissions, we focused on datasets from the United States Environmental Agency (EPA). 
The EPA tracks total U.S. emissions by publishing an inventory of the US Greenhouse Gas Emission by power plants. 
This annual report estimates the total national greenhouse gas emissions and removals associated with human activities across the United States.

Since 1990, gross U.S. greenhouse gas emissions have increased by 2 percent. 
From year to year, emissions can rise and fall due to changes in the economy, the price of fuel, and other factors. 
In 2019, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions decreased compared to 2018 levels. 
The decrease was primarily in CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion, which was a result of multiple factors, including a decrease in total energy use and a continued shift from coal to less carbon intensive natural gas and renewables. 
Industry reporting with the EPA is focusing their research on improving CO2 emissions, which have significant impacts on climate warming. CO2 is the largest greenhouse gas emission, in terms of quantity, and power plants were the largest contributers of emissions in the US in 2020.


Our group has chosen to study CO2 emissions by power plants in the US in order to understand trends in climate change and potential for carbon capture implementation.
At the end of the project, we would like to propose a basic tool, which could be used to identify basins where the emissions are high enough and the economic dynamism could support the deployment of a carbon capture investment.



_With our data analysis project, we hope to answer the following questions:_

• Where are the main CO2 emitters located?

• What is the impact of the 45Q Tax Credit policy, implemented in the US since 2008?

• Which industries would be economically relevant to deploy carbon capture investment?

• If we analyze the economic growth of the US Industries, what are some possible trends in the CO2 emissions in the near future?

• Does the increase or decrease of the industry types influence the emission rate?

• How can we compare the carbon emissions between direct emitters and other facility types?

## Results

Analysis of Global Emissions:
After analyzing global emissions from the EPA dataset, we found that there is a decrease in direct emissions over the last decade of approximately 600 M. 
The reduction of emissions is mainly supported by the decline of coal usage in the US in the past decade. The natural gas consumption is stable. The petroleum product consumption is also in decline.

The main emitter states are Texas, Florida, and Louisiana. The global reduction in emissions for these main states was between 7 and 20% for the last five years. There was also a reduction of 27.6% of emissions in Illinois in the past 5 years.

## Summary


• Where are the main CO2 emitters located?
The main CO2 emitters are located near areas with large population concentration, near major US cities. We see the largest emitters in Texas, Lousiana, and Florida, which house major oil and gas industries. 

• What is the impact of the 45Q Tax Credit policy, implemented in the US since 2008?

• Which industries would be economically relevant to deploy carbon capture investment?

• If we analyze the economic growth of the US Industries, what are some possible trends in the CO2 emissions in the near future?

• Does the increase or decrease of the industry types influence the emission rate?

• How can we compare the carbon emissions between direct emitters and other facility types?
