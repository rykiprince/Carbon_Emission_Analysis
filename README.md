Greenhouse gases trap heat and make the planet warmer. Human activities are responsible for almost all of the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere over the last 150 years.1 The largest source of greenhouse gas emissions from human activities in the United States is from burning fossil fuels for electricity, heat, and transportation.

Since 1990, gross U.S. greenhouse gas emissions have increased by 2 percent. From year to year, emissions can rise and fall due to changes in the economy, the price of fuel, and other factors. In 2019, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions decreased compared to 2018 levels. The decrease was primarily in CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion which was a result of multiple factors, including a decrease in total energy use and a continued shift from coal to less carbon intensive natural gas and renewables.
We will restraint our data analysis project to the CO2 emissions. Industrials are focusing their research and improvement on the CO2 emissions which have the main impact on the climate warming. At the end of the project, we would like to propose a basic tool which could be used to identify basins where the emissions are high enough and the economic dynamism could support the deployment of a carbon capture investment.

The main database we are working on is from the United States Environmental Agency (EPA). EPA tracks total U.S. emissions by publishing an inventory of the US Greenhouse Gas Emission by plants. This annual report estimates the total national greenhouse gas emissions and removals associated with human activities across the United States.
With our data analysis project, we hope to answer the following questions:

•	Where are located the main CO2 emitters,

•	What is the impact of the 45Q Tax Credit policy in place in the US since 2008,

•	Which industries would be economically relevant to deploy carbon capture investment,

•	What could be the trend of the CO2 emissions in the near future if we analyze the economic growth of the US industries,

•	Does the increase or decrease of the industry types of influx on the emission rate,
    (using the ghgp_data_by_year.xlsx)
    
•	Comparing the carbon emissions between direct emitters and other facility types.
